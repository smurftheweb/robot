This project covers creating an autonomous robot using the raspberry pi. 

The end goal is to use a webcam (and in the future, potentially other sensors), to feed a neural network which will drive the robot.

If you are ever using this, it is designed using raspbian (armhf), as it offers significant speed boosts. It also relies on python 2.7
and opencv 2.3, using the cv2 packages, as they seem to be a bit quicker as well.
